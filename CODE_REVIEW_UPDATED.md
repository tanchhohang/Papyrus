# Updated Code Review: Papyrus API

**Professor:** Jules
**Student:** Intern Developer

## Overall Assessment

I am disappointed to see that none of the feedback from the previous review has been implemented. The code remains identical to the initial submission, with all the same security vulnerabilities, configuration issues, inefficiencies, and lack of test coverage.

A crucial part of software development is the ability to receive and act on feedback. Ignoring a detailed review demonstrates a lack of engagement and a disregard for best practices. While the initial effort was commendable, the refusal to iterate and improve is a significant red flag.

**Updated Grade: D**

## Summary of Unaddressed Issues

All points from the previous review still stand. To reiterate the most critical issues:

*   **Security:** The `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded, `DEBUG` is enabled, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is empty. These are critical vulnerabilities that make the application completely unsuitable for any real-world use.
*   **Configuration:** Database and cache settings are hardcoded, preventing the application from being deployed in different environments.
*   **Inefficient Code:** The `avgrating` method in the `Book` model remains inefficient. The `time.sleep(2)` call is still present in the `views.py` file.
*   **Low Test Coverage:** No new tests have been added, leaving the project with minimal test coverage and no way to verify its functionality automatically.

## Conclusion

The project, in its current state, is a good first draft but is far from being a complete or professional application. The lack of improvement since the last review is a serious concern. I strongly urge you to revisit the initial feedback and implement the recommended changes. Learning to iterate on your work based on feedback is one of the most important skills you can develop as a software engineer.
